# LLM Content Strategist Brief: Case Study Creation

## System Overview
You are tasked with creating compelling case studies for Kyle McGraw's product portfolio. Each case study must demonstrate measurable business impact through structured content and metadata.

## Output Requirements

### Primary Deliverables
1. **Metadata JSON object** (database entry)
2. **Metrics array** (impact showcase)
3. **Structured markdown content** (800-1200 words)

---

## 1. Metadata Structure

Generate this exact JSON structure for database insertion:

```json
{
  "title": "string (max 30 chars, project name)",
  "description": "string (max 120 chars, value prop with key result)",
  "slug": "string (kebab-case URL identifier)",
  "category": "Strategy | UX | Analytics",
  "aiAccelerated": boolean,
  "role": "string (specific role title)",
  "engagementType": "Full-time | Contract | Advisory", 
  "location": "string (Remote | City Name)",
  "timeline": "string (YYYY–YYYY or YYYY–Present format)",
  "status": "Ongoing | Completed",
  "tools": ["array", "of", "tool", "names"],
  "services": ["array", "of", "skill", "chips"],
  "order": integer
}
```

### Category Selection Logic
- **Strategy**: Business transformation, funding, roadmap, vision work
- **UX**: User research, design, usability, experience optimization  
- **Analytics**: Data-driven optimization, A/B testing, metrics improvement

```

### Skill Selection Algorithm
1. **Identify primary category** based on project type
2. **Select 3-4 core skills** from primary category
3. **Add 2-3 supporting skills** from secondary categories
4. **Include 1-2 collaboration skills** (always relevant)
5. **Add AI skills** if any AI/automation was involved
6. **Include business skills** if revenue/growth impact occurred

---

## 3. Metrics Structure

Generate 3-4 metrics that demonstrate quantifiable impact:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "string (metric name)",
    "stat": "string (final result with units/currency/percentage)",
    "description": "string (context about what this represents)",
    "previousStat": "string (optional, starting point)",
    "change": "string (percentage or amount of improvement)",
    "changeType": "increase | decrease"
  }
]
```

### Metric Categories & Examples

#### Revenue/Business Metrics
```json
{
  "name": "Funding Secured",
  "stat": "$2.3M",
  "description": "Series A round completed",
  "change": "+100%",
  "changeType": "increase"
}
```

#### User Experience Metrics
```json
{
  "name": "Conversion Rate", 
  "stat": "34%",
  "previousStat": "28%",
  "change": "+21%",
  "changeType": "increase",
  "description": "Overall site conversion improvement"
}
```

#### Efficiency Metrics
```json
{
  "name": "Time to Market",
  "stat": "3 weeks", 
  "previousStat": "6+ months",
  "change": "-75%",
  "changeType": "increase",
  "description": "From concept to prototype"
}
```

#### Engagement Metrics
```json
{
  "name": "User Satisfaction",
  "stat": "4.8/5",
  "previousStat": "3.2/5", 
  "change": "+50%",
  "changeType": "increase",
  "description": "Post-redesign NPS score"
}
```

- **Specificity**: Include exact numbers, percentages, timeframes, participant counts
- **Structure**: Use bullet points for lists, bold for emphasis, clear hierarchies
- **Length**: Target 800-1200 words total across all sections
- **Perspective**: First person ("I designed", "I led", "I analyzed")

### Content Optimization Rules
1. **Lead with impact** in every section
2. **Quantify everything** possible (participants, timeframes, improvements)
3. **Show causation** between actions and results
4. **Include industry context** where relevant
5. **Demonstrate strategic thinking** beyond tactical execution
