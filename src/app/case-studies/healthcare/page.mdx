# Healthcare Portal Design

A patient-facing healthcare portal redesign focused on accessibility, privacy, and streamlined care coordination for a regional health system.

## Project Overview

**Client**: Regional healthcare network with 200,000+ patients  
**Timeline**: 9 months (September 2023 - May 2024)  
**Role**: Senior UX Designer & Accessibility Specialist  
**Team**: 2 designers, 3 developers, 1 HIPAA compliance officer

**Challenge**
The existing patient portal had low adoption rates and poor usability scores. Patients struggled to schedule appointments, access test results, and communicate with care teams. The interface also had significant accessibility gaps.

## Coming Soon

This case study is currently being documented. It will include:

- **Accessibility Design**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and inclusive design
- **Privacy & Security**: HIPAA-compliant interface design patterns
- **Patient Journey Mapping**: Understanding complex healthcare workflows
- **Results**: Adoption rates, patient satisfaction, and operational efficiency gains
