        <h2>Executive summary</h2>

        <p>Healthcare providers were spending 60% of their time on administrative tasks instead of patient care. The existing portal was fragmented, making it difficult to access critical patient information quickly. I redesigned the healthcare portal with a focus on care coordination, streamlined workflows, and intelligent data presentation that prioritized the most relevant information for each user role.</p>

        <h3>Why it matters</h3>

        <p>When healthcare providers can't quickly access patient information, both care quality and efficiency suffer. A well-designed portal becomes the foundation for better patient outcomes and reduced administrative burden.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2>What I did</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Conducted 24 healthcare provider interviews and 3-day shadowing sessions in clinical settings</li>
          <li>Performed workflow analysis across 4 departments and comprehensive patient journey mapping</li>
          <li>Analyzed portal usage data, task completion times, and support ticket patterns</li>
          <li>Redesigned information architecture to prioritize critical patient data by user role</li>
          <li>Created streamlined workflows that reduced administrative overhead</li>
          <li>Implemented intelligent data presentation that surfaces relevant information contextually</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>AI-Enhanced Research</strong>: Leveraged AI tools to analyze interview transcripts, identify patterns across user feedback, and generate initial persona drafts. This reduced analysis time from 2 weeks to 4 days while uncovering deeper insights.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <hr />

        <h2>Coming Soon</h2>

        <p>This case study is currently being expanded with comprehensive documentation, including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Detailed Research Findings</strong>: Complete user journey analysis and pain point documentation</li>
          <li><strong>Design Process</strong>: Wireframes, prototypes, and iterative testing results</li>
          <li><strong>Implementation Details</strong>: Technical specifications and development collaboration</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term Impact</strong>: 12-month follow-up metrics and organizational changes</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Measurable Results</strong>: Within 6 months of launch, the portal became the primary tool for 89% of healthcare providers, with administrative task time reduced by nearly half.</p>
