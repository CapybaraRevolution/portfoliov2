        <h2>Project Overview</h2>

        <p><strong>The Challenge</strong><br />
        Healthcare providers were spending 60% of their time on administrative tasks instead of patient care. The existing portal was fragmented, making it difficult to access critical patient information quickly.</p>

        <p><strong>The Solution</strong><br />
        Redesigned the healthcare portal with a focus on care coordination, streamlined workflows, and intelligent data presentation that prioritized the most relevant information for each user role.</p>

        <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>24 healthcare provider interviews</li>
          <li>3-day shadowing sessions in clinical settings</li>
          <li>Workflow analysis across 4 departments</li>
          <li>Patient journey mapping</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Portal usage analytics review</li>
          <li>Task completion time measurements</li>
          <li>Error rate and support ticket analysis</li>
          <li>Accessibility audit findings</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>AI-Enhanced Research</strong>: Leveraged AI tools to analyze interview transcripts, identify patterns across user feedback, and generate initial persona drafts. This reduced analysis time from 2 weeks to 4 days while uncovering deeper insights.</p>

        <h2>Key Outcomes</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Admin Time Reduction</strong>: -45% per patient interaction</li>
          <li><strong>Data Access Speed</strong>: +200% critical info retrieval</li>
          <li><strong>User Satisfaction</strong>: 4.7/5 provider rating</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Coming Soon</h2>

        <p>This case study is currently being expanded with comprehensive documentation, including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Detailed Research Findings</strong>: Complete user journey analysis and pain point documentation</li>
          <li><strong>Design Process</strong>: Wireframes, prototypes, and iterative testing results</li>
          <li><strong>Implementation Details</strong>: Technical specifications and development collaboration</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term Impact</strong>: 12-month follow-up metrics and organizational changes</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Measurable Results</strong>: Within 6 months of launch, the portal became the primary tool for 89% of healthcare providers, with administrative task time reduced by nearly half.</p>
