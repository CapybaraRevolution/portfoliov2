        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>I led UX for a secure, internal web application that sat on top of a <strong>Salesforce</strong> data schema. The portal was used by researchers, business teams, and senior decision-makers to <strong>analyze product budgets, evaluate program outcomes, and manage information across multiple systems</strong>. My remit spanned discovery through implementation support: mapping data to user needs, shaping the information architecture, designing data-heavy interfaces, and partnering with engineering to deliver a reliable tool in a regulated environment.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Constraints</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Regulated context:</strong> Strict privacy, auditability, and access controls.</li>
          <li><strong>Complex data model:</strong> Salesforce objects/relationships needed to translate cleanly into usable UI concepts.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-system reality:</strong> Data pipelines bridged Salesforce and other internal systems; error/latency states had to be first-class.</li>
          <li><strong>Mixed user base:</strong> Researchers, analysts, and business leaders—each with different goals and permissions.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2>What I Did</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>System & data mapping:</strong> Partnered with data/engineering to map <strong>Salesforce objects</strong> and relationships to concrete user jobs, shaping navigation, filters, and drill-downs.</li>
          <li><strong>API analysis & integration notes:</strong> Reviewed available endpoints (REST/SOQL), auth/limits, error semantics, and paging. Documented <strong>integration contracts</strong> and edge cases for developers.</li>
          <li><strong>Information architecture:</strong> Defined content groups, table anatomy, sort/filter patterns, and role-based visibility for sensitive fields.</li>
          <li><strong>Data-heavy UI design:</strong> Wireframed dashboards, comparison views, and detail pages; specified empty, loading, and error states so the UI stayed trustworthy under real-world conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Visualization standards:</strong> Established conventions for charts/tables (legends, units, thresholds), and when to chart vs. table for clarity.</li>
          <li><strong>Delivery support:</strong> Authored PRDs/acceptance criteria, paired with devs during implementation, and supported QA for high-risk flows.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2>Deliverables</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Current/Future system diagrams</strong> (lightweight C4-ish) showing data flows and permission boundaries</li>
          <li><strong>API/integration notes</strong> (endpoints, payloads, failure states, retries)</li>
          <li><strong>Wireframes & interaction specs</strong> for dashboards, filters, and record detail views</li>
          <li><strong>Data dictionary & field glossary</strong> to align naming and units across teams</li>
          <li><strong>UX writing & states</strong> (empty/loading/error/help) for analyst-grade clarity</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2>Outcome</h2>

        <p>The first release shipped to internal users with <strong>consistent patterns</strong>, clearer data navigation, and trustworthy behaviors under load and failure. Teams reported <strong>faster analysis cycles</strong> and <strong>cleaner handoffs</strong> between research and business operations. The portal now provides a maintainable foundation for new modules without reinventing core interaction patterns.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Tools & Stack</h2>

        <p><strong>Salesforce</strong> (data model & auth), <strong>Figma</strong> (wireframes/prototypes), <strong>Jira/Confluence</strong> (delivery), <strong>Miro</strong> (system mapping), <strong>Tableau</strong> (visualization exploration).</p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Learnings</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Great internal tools <strong>translate schemas into human workflows</strong>—not the other way around.</li>
          <li>In data-dense UIs, <strong>states and semantics</strong> (empty/loading/error) are as important as charts.</li>
          <li>Early integration notes prevent "invisible" complexity from surfacing late as rework.</li>
        </ul>
