# E-commerce Platform Redesign

A comprehensive redesign of a mid-market e-commerce platform that increased conversion rates by 34% and reduced cart abandonment by 28% over six months.

## Project Overview

**Client**: Mid-market fashion retailer with $50M annual revenue  
**Timeline**: 6 months (March - September 2023)  
**Role**: Lead Product Manager & UX Designer  
**Team**: 2 developers, 1 designer, 1 QA engineer

**Challenge**
The existing e-commerce platform had declining conversion rates (2.1%) and high cart abandonment (78%). Mobile experience was particularly poor, with 65% of traffic but only 15% of conversions coming from mobile devices.

## Research & Discovery

**User Research Methods**
- 15 customer interviews (mix of converters and abandoners)
- Usability testing sessions with 8 participants
- Analytics analysis of 6 months of user behavior data
- Heatmap analysis of key pages (homepage, product, checkout)
- Competitive analysis of 5 direct competitors

**Key Findings**
- 67% of users couldn't find size information easily
- Checkout process had 8 steps (industry average: 4)
- Product images loaded slowly on mobile (4.2s average)
- 45% of users couldn't find shipping costs until final step
- Search functionality returned irrelevant results 23% of the time

## Strategy & Solution

**Primary Goals**
1. Reduce friction in the shopping experience
2. Optimize mobile conversion funnel
3. Improve product discovery and information architecture
4. Streamline checkout process

**Design Principles**
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Transparent pricing throughout the journey
- Visual hierarchy emphasizing product benefits
- Trust signals and social proof integration

## Implementation

### Phase 3: Mobile Optimization (Months 5-6)

**Mobile Experience**
