# SaaS Dashboard Redesign

A comprehensive dashboard redesign for an enterprise software platform that simplified complex workflows and dramatically improved user productivity.

## Project Overview

**Client**: Enterprise SaaS platform serving 10,000+ businesses  
**Timeline**: 6 months (June - December 2023)  
**Role**: Senior UX Strategist & Information Architect  
**Team**: 2 UX designers, 4 developers, 1 product manager

**Challenge**
Users struggled with information overload in the existing dashboard. Key metrics were buried, workflows were fragmented across multiple screens, and new users required extensive training to become productive.

## Coming Soon

This case study is currently being documented. It will include:

- **Information Architecture**: Restructuring complex data hierarchies
- **User Flow Optimization**: Streamlining multi-step processes
- **Dashboard Design**: Creating scannable, actionable interfaces
- **Results**: Productivity gains, user satisfaction, and business impact
