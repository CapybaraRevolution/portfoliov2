          <p>I thrive on chaos. Take a big mess and throw me into the deep end—I'll come back with charts, graphs, and a clear direction.

                    Fun metaphors aside, the point of UX research isn't to drown in dashboards. It's to understand how things are actually being used. I love that instrumentation reduces guesswork because I get to make decisions faster. Also, I get to say these decisions are <Tooltip content="Buzzword for 'I looked at some numbers before making this decision' (usually said while pointing at a chart)."><span className="font-bold">data-driven</span></Tooltip> (people love that.)
                    My loop stayed intentionally simple. That's why the output wasn't a giant research deck. It was a practical shortlist of "fix this next" items—
                    tied to specific journeys (especially prospective students) and backed by evidence I could point to in a meeting without theatrics.

        <p>In 2016, Cornell combined three business schools under the SC Johnson College of Business. By 2024, the web experience <em>still</em> behaved like three separate institutions → different navigation patterns, different terminology, different page structures. This made even basic tasks hard to navigate.</p>
        <p>Prospective students were the <strong>most important user group</strong>. They were also one of the most troubled. They were trying to compare programs, understand admissions, and find requirements that could take one of three forms. This mismatch of <em>&quot;same goal, different layout, different verbiage&quot;</em> created inconsistency. The kind of inconsistency that <strong>quietly erodes trust</strong>. An especially costly dilemma considering the prospective student was the highest-priority user journey.</p>

            How I Created Clarity

          <p>
             I joined the project (via Briteweb). Working as a UX strategist, my job was to somehow attack this messy situation, and change the trajectory toward something resembling a <strong>coherent digital experience</strong>. If a user needs a mental model of Cornell&apos;s org chart to find a programme, we&apos;ve already lost. I needed to provide rules the team could actually run with, and I was dead-set on creating wireframes and documentation that Cornell&apos;s internal team could <em>own and evolve</em>. I approached this like any other project: start by understanding where users fall off. I needed to identify the <strong>source of our problems</strong> if we wanted to build a system that would prevent these same problems from reappearing.

          <p>The strategy with AI on this project wasn&apos;t &quot;AI magic.&quot; It was <strong>internal acceleration</strong> → fewer hours spent on admin work, more time making the system coherent.

                  The on-page content sidebar shown here is a good example. It needed to reflect the page's hierarchy, allow users to navigate to specific sections, and communicate their current position as they scroll. That's a lot of behavior to get right—and easy to misinterpret without clear documentation.

                  These weren't presentation decks designed to impress stakeholders. They were working documents designed to reduce back-and-forth between design and development. When a developer had a question about edge cases or interaction states, the answer was already documented.
