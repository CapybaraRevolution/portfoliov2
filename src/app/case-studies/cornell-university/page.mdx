        <h2>Goal: Unify three distinct institutions through a cohesive digital experience</h2>

        <p><strong>Context:</strong> In 2016, Cornell combined three business schools under SC Johnson (Johnson, Nolan, Dyson). By 2024, the web presence still reflected three mindsets, three vocabularies, and three site patterns. I was brought in (via Briteweb) to help analyze the problem, align stakeholders, and design a coherent system the internal team could own.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Why this mattered</h2>

        <p>Fragmentation was eroding trust and task success. Users (especially prospective students) struggled with inconsistent navigation, terminology, and page modules—creating unnecessary exits on high-value paths.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2>What I did</h2>

        <h3>1) Insights (Data-informed, human-interpreted)</h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Triangulated quant + qual: Hotjar/GA patterns + session observations to locate drop-offs and friction.</li>
          <li>Mapped priority journeys (e.g., prospective student tasks) to affected pages/modules.</li>
          <li>Produced a risk-to-remedy matrix: problem → hypothesis → design probe → success signal.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>We needed to bridge the gaps between these institutions.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Users want a single, predictable path from A → B.</strong></p>

          <div className="p-4 mt-2 bg-zinc-50 dark:bg-zinc-800/50 rounded-lg">
            <p>We treated analytics like a map (where to dig) and observation like a metal detector (exactly where the signal is strongest).</p>

        <h3>2) Understand the user (personas + user stories)</h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Created/validated personas (e.g., Prospective Student) to anchor decisions.</li>
          <li>Wrote user stories per archetype to drive IA and module design.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>A grounded persona keeps choices honest and focused.</strong></p>

        <h3>3) Module design (system first)</h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Designed a library of page modules (hero, program cards, stats, admissions CTAs, etc.) with clear inputs/variants.</li>
          <li>Documented each module's anatomy and usage so SC Johnson's team could evolve it safely.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Documentation made the system teachable.</strong></p>

      <div className="prose prose-zinc dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
        <h3>4) Navigation system (patterns + rules)</h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Prototyped and iterated site-wide navigation (global, sectional, in-page).</li>
          <li>Defined naming, grouping, and wayfinding rules tied to user tasks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Flowcharts showed how the pieces click together.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Clarity scales when the rules are simple and explicit.</strong></p>

      />

      <div className="prose prose-zinc dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
        <h3>5) Handoff (so it lives beyond us)</h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Organized the Figma file for hand-off ownership: naming, spacing tokens, componentization, example pages.</li>
          <li>Provided PRD-lite specs for modules and nav, so engineering could implement predictably.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2>Where AI helped (AI-Accelerated ✅)</h2>

        <p><strong>Human-in-the-loop, safety-first.</strong> No automated decisions shipped without review.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>IA clustering aid:</strong> used LLMs to cluster program pages and surface naming collisions—we made the calls, the model just accelerated the first pass.</li>
          <li><strong>Story synthesis:</strong> drafted first-pass user stories from research notes, then edited for accuracy.</li>
          <li><strong>Content linting:</strong> flagged inconsistent terminology between schools (style/voice checks).</li>
          <li><strong>Doc automation:</strong> generated structured checklists from module specs to speed QA.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Result:</strong> faster first-drafts, better consistency checks, and more time for the real work—talking to stakeholders and simplifying journeys.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Outcomes (directional; safe-to-share)</h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Findability improved in unmoderated tests for key tasks after the IA/nav prototype.</li>
          <li>Bounce rate trended down on problem pages post-module standardization (early baseline).</li>
          <li>Consistency debt reduced with a documented module library and naming rules.</li>
          <li>Internal clarity: stakeholders cited clearer shared language and easier onboarding.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2>Learnings</h2>

        <p>Complex mergers need more than visuals—they need shared rules. By combining data, plain-language documentation, and a maintainable design system (plus selective AI assists), we helped Cornell SC Johnson act like one institution online—without losing each school's identity.</p>
