            <p>In 2016, Cornell combined three business schools under the SC Johnson College of Business (Johnson, Nolan, and Dyson). By 2024, the web experience still behaved like three separate institutions: different navigation patterns, different terminology, and different page structures that made it harder than it should be to do basic tasks.</p>
            <p>Prospective students were the clearest signal. They were trying to compare programs, understand admissions, and find requirements quickly. Instead, they kept running into mismatch: "same goal, different layout, different labels." That kind of inconsistency quietly erodes trust, and it's especially costly on high-intent journeys.</p>
            <p>I joined the project via Briteweb to help diagnose the problem, align stakeholders, and design a system Cornell's internal team could own and evolve.</p>

              <p>We designed a library of reusable page modules (heroes, program cards, stats blocks, admissions CTAs, content sections) with:</p>
