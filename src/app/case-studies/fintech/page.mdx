# FinTech Mobile App Design

A complete mobile banking application redesign focused on security, usability, and regulatory compliance that transformed the user experience and business metrics.

## Project Overview

**Client**: Mid-market financial services company  
**Timeline**: 8 months (January - August 2024)  
**Role**: Product Designer & UX Strategist  
**Team**: 3 developers, 1 security specialist, 1 compliance officer

**Challenge**
The existing mobile app had poor user adoption (23% monthly active users) and high abandonment rates during onboarding (67%). Users complained about complex authentication flows and difficulty finding key features.

## Coming Soon

This case study is currently being documented. It will include:

- **User Research**: Security-focused user interviews and behavioral analysis
- **Design Process**: Wireframes, prototypes, and usability testing results  
- **Compliance Considerations**: Meeting financial regulatory requirements
- **Results**: Engagement metrics, adoption rates, and user satisfaction scores
