          The work helped move Breeze from "we have ideas" to "we have a product story investors can actually experience." That mattered because time wasn't on our side, and clarity was the fastest way to buy runway.

        <h2 id="the-mess">The Mess</h2>

        <p>When I joined, the product was a mix of scattered wireframes, half-formed requirements, and a beta that looked and behaved like it had missed a few years of the internet. The value proposition wasn't landing, the flows didn't line up with user goals, and "what happens next" depended on who you asked that day.</p>

        <p>There was also an AI-shaped hole in the roadmap. Not "add AI because it's 2025," but grounded opportunities for categorization, classification, and guidance that could remove friction from the most tedious parts of the mortgage application process. None of that was framed yet.</p>

        <p>The harder part: we weren't just fixing the present. We also needed a clear future scope and a roadmap that wouldn't collapse under its own complexity.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="my-role">My Role</h2>

        <p>I was brought in as an independent contractor supporting the CEO as a UX lead and product strategist. My job was to turn a loose vision into a coherent system the team could build.</p>

        <p><strong>What I optimized for:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear information architecture and navigation (so people stop getting lost)</li>
          <li>Consistent patterns and component behavior (so the UI has "design DNA," not vibes)</li>
          <li>Requirements that are dev-ready (so shipping doesn't become an interpretive sport)</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="how-i-created-clarity">How I Created Clarity</h2>

        <p>I began with discovery, an audit of what existed, and competitive scanning across fintech and workflow-heavy tools. The goal wasn't to copy UI—it was to understand what "normal" looks like when complexity is handled well.</p>

        <p>I moved quickly into prototypes because we had a classic situation: about 60% of the product was understood, and the remaining 40% was a fog bank. Prototyping turned that fog into decisions. It surfaced broken assumptions early, de-risked future flows, and forced the information architecture to reveal where it would bend or break.</p>

        <p>From there, I designed a full system—not isolated screens:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>End-to-end critical paths (application → documents → review → payments)</li>
          <li>Component patterns for form fields, validation, status, and progressive disclosure (so the UI stays calm even when the process isn't)</li>
          <li>Clickable prototypes with meaningful states and transitions (not "happy path theatre")</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="where-ai-fit">Where AI Fit (Practical, Not Performative)</h2>

        <p>We identified areas where AI could reduce grunt work without introducing risk:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Smart form assist to reduce typing and rework</li>
          <li>Predictive document classification so humans aren't forced to play foul detective</li>
          <li>Lightweight conversational guidance for complex steps</li>
          <li>An "Ask Breeze" helper for drafting broker-to-client messages and document text, with the broker approving before sending</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="what-shipped">What Shipped</h2>

        <p>This wasn't a single handoff file. It was a connected package:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Interactive prototypes suitable for stakeholder and investor walkthroughs</li>
          <li>A componentized design system foundation with interaction rules and states</li>
          <li>UX artifacts (journeys, IA maps, decision notes) anchored to user outcomes</li>
          <li>Dev-friendly acceptance criteria and requirements for high-risk or ambiguous areas</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>In early-stage products, clarity beats velocity.</strong> Wireframes and prototypes prevent expensive "fast" mistakes later.</li>
          <li><strong>Investors don't want a whitepaper.</strong> They want to feel the product. Interactive prototypes compress explanation time.</li>
          <li><strong>Mortgages are complex. The UX job is to keep the experience calm and predictable</strong> while the system carries the complexity: clear status, clear steps, the right guidance, and low cognitive load.</li>
