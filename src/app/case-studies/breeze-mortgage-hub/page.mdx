        <h2>Goal: transform an incomplete product into a modern, AI-enabled experience that's clearer for users and easier for the team to ship.</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>Breeze arrived with a partly built app, uneven UX, and unfinished flows. I stepped in as <strong>UX Lead, Business Analyst, and AI Strategist</strong> to clarify what we're building and why—then translate that into wireframes, prototypes, and implementation-ready specs.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2>The challenge</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fragmented UX:</strong> screens didn't line up with user goals; key flows were incomplete</li>
          <li><strong>Unclear handoff:</strong> requirements weren't shaped into dev-ready specs</li>
          <li><strong>Missed opportunities for AI:</strong> no plan for intelligent assistance or automation</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2>My approach</h2>

        <h3>Unify product and UX strategy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Align on target outcomes, risks, and success signals</li>
          <li>Map the IA, user journeys, and system constraints to reduce rework</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design the system, not just screens</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Mid-fidelity wireframes for every critical path (apply, docs, review, payments)</li>
          <li>Componentized patterns for form fields, validation, progressive disclosure, and status</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prototype to de-risk</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Clickable prototypes with <strong>state changes</strong> to show real behaviors (empty, loading, error, success)</li>
          <li>Usability tests to expose friction before engineering commits</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Introduce practical AI</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Smart form assist (pre-fill from docs), predictive doc classification, and simple conversational guidance for complex steps</li>
          <li>Instrument minimum events required to prove impact in Step 5</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2>Selected outcomes</h2>

        <h2>What I delivered</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>IA and journey maps tied to measurable outcomes</li>
          <li>Full set of wireframes and interaction notes</li>
          <li>Dev-ready PRDs for priority flows (inputs, rules, and edge cases)</li>
          <li>Prototype package demonstrating critical states and transitions</li>
          <li>AI opportunity map + minimal instrumentation plan to verify impact</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2>Where AI helped (AI-Accelerated ✅)</h2>

        <p><strong>AI integration strategy and implementation guidance for mortgage workflow automation.</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Smart form assistance:</strong> Designed AI pre-fill system that extracts data from uploaded documents to auto-populate mortgage application fields</li>
          <li><strong>Document classification:</strong> Architected predictive document recognition to automatically categorize uploaded files (tax returns, pay stubs, bank statements)</li>
          <li><strong>Conversational guidance:</strong> Created AI-powered contextual help that provides step-by-step assistance for complex mortgage terms and requirements</li>
          <li><strong>Error prevention:</strong> Developed intelligent validation patterns that predict and prevent common form errors before submission</li>
          <li><strong>Workflow optimization:</strong> Used AI to analyze user paths and identify friction points for prioritized UX improvements</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Reduced cognitive load and accelerated form completion while maintaining transparency and user control over AI suggestions.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Learnings</h2>

        <p>Pairing UX strategy with business analysis and practical AI delivers compounding returns: clearer decisions, less rework, and a product that feels powerful without being complex.</p>

        <p><strong>Big takeaway:</strong> even high-stakes processes like mortgages can feel simple when you combine strong UX, explicit system design, and just-enough AI.</p>
