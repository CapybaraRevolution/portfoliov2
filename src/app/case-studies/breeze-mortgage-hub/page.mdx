        <h2>Goal: transform an incomplete product into a modern, AI-enabled experience that's clearer for users and easier for the team to ship.</h2>

        <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

        <p>Breeze arrived with a partly built app, uneven UX, and unfinished flows. The team needed to secure Series A funding but lacked a cohesive product vision that investors could understand. I stepped in as <strong>UX Lead, Business Analyst, and AI Strategist</strong> to clarify what we're building and why—then translate that into wireframes, prototypes, and implementation-ready specs that would resonate with both users and investors.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Investor confusion:</strong> scattered wireframes and documentation couldn't communicate the value proposition</li>
          <li><strong>Fragmented UX:</strong> screens didn't line up with user goals; key flows were incomplete</li>
          <li><strong>Unclear handoff:</strong> requirements weren't shaped into dev-ready specs</li>
          <li><strong>Missed opportunities for AI:</strong> no plan for intelligent assistance or automation</li>
          <li><strong>Time pressure:</strong> needed to clarify vision quickly to secure funding runway</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Usability tests to expose friction before engineering commits</li>

        <h3>Series A funding secured</h3>
        <p><strong>$2.3M raised</strong> after demonstrating the interactive prototypes to investors. The clickable prototypes were <strong>10x more effective</strong> than static presentations—investors could see and feel the product experience, not just read about it. This led to a <strong>+180% increase</strong> in investor meeting requests.</p>

        <h2 id="where-ai-helped">Where AI helped (AI-Accelerated ✅)</h2>

        <p><strong>AI integration strategy and implementation guidance for mortgage workflow automation.</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Smart form assistance:</strong> Designed AI pre-fill system that extracts data from uploaded documents to auto-populate mortgage application fields</li>
          <li><strong>Document classification:</strong> Architected predictive document recognition to automatically categorize uploaded files (tax returns, pay stubs, bank statements)</li>
          <li><strong>Conversational guidance:</strong> Created AI-powered contextual help that provides step-by-step assistance for complex mortgage terms and requirements</li>
          <li><strong>Error prevention:</strong> Developed intelligent validation patterns that predict and prevent common form errors before submission</li>
          <li><strong>Workflow optimization:</strong> Used AI to analyze user paths and identify friction points for prioritized UX improvements</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Reduced cognitive load and accelerated form completion while maintaining transparency and user control over AI suggestions.</p>

        <h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>

        <p>Pairing UX strategy with business analysis and practical AI delivers compounding returns: clearer decisions, less rework, and a product that feels powerful without being complex.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Investors need to see and feel the product experience, not just read about it. Interactive prototypes were 10x more effective than static presentations in securing funding.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><strong>Big takeaway:</strong> even high-stakes processes like mortgages can feel simple when you combine strong UX, explicit system design, and just-enough AI. The same clarity that helps users navigate complex flows also helps investors understand product value.</p>
