            <p>When I joined, the product was a mix of scattered wireframes, half-formed requirements, and a beta that looked and behaved like it had missed a few years of the internet. The value proposition wasn't landing, the flows didn't line up with user goals, and "what happens next" depended on who you asked that day.</p>
            <p>There was also an AI-shaped hole in the roadmap. Not "add AI because it's 2025," but grounded opportunities for categorization, classification, and guidance that could remove friction from the most tedious parts of the mortgage application process. None of that was framed yet.</p>
            <p>The harder part: we weren't just fixing the present. We also needed a clear future scope and a roadmap that wouldn't collapse under its own complexity.</p>

          <Heading id="how-i-created-clarity" level={2} label="Before and After">How I Created Clarity</Heading>
          <p>I began with <Tooltip content="The research phase where you learn about users, business goals, and constraints before designing anything—interviews, audits, and lots of 'why?' questions."><span className="font-bold">discovery</span></Tooltip>, an audit of what existed, and <Tooltip content="Systematic review of competitor products to identify patterns, gaps, and opportunities—not to copy, but to understand industry conventions."><span className="font-bold">competitive scanning</span></Tooltip> across fintech and workflow-heavy tools. The goal wasn't to copy UI—it was to understand what "normal" looks like when complexity is handled well.</p>
          <p>I moved quickly into prototypes because we had a classic situation: about 60% of the product was understood, and the remaining 40% was a fog bank. Prototyping turned that fog into decisions. It surfaced broken assumptions early, <Tooltip content="Reducing uncertainty by testing ideas before building—cheaper to fix a prototype than production code."><span className="font-bold">de-risked</span></Tooltip> future flows, and forced the information architecture to reveal where it would bend or break.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="prose prose-zinc dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
          <p>From there, I designed a full system—not isolated screens:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>End-to-end critical paths (application → documents → review → payments)</li>
            <li><Tooltip content="Standardized rules for how UI elements look and behave—ensuring buttons, inputs, and feedback work consistently across the product."><span className="font-bold">Component patterns</span></Tooltip> for form fields, validation, status, and <Tooltip content="A UX technique that reveals information gradually as needed, preventing overwhelm by showing only what's relevant at each step."><span className="font-bold">progressive disclosure</span></Tooltip> (so the UI stays calm even when the process isn't)</li>
            <li><Tooltip content="Interactive mockups that simulate real product behavior—stakeholders can click through flows instead of imagining them from static screens."><span className="font-bold">Clickable prototypes</span></Tooltip> with meaningful states and transitions (not "<Tooltip content="Demos that only show the ideal scenario—ignoring errors, edge cases, and the messy reality users actually encounter."><span className="font-bold">happy path theatre</span></Tooltip>")</li>

          <p>We identified areas where AI could reduce grunt work without introducing risk.
