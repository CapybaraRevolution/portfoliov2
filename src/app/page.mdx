# Who Am I?

I&apos;m Kyle McGraw: a hybrid UX Designer and Business Analyst who loves turning messy problem spaces into clear, testable ideas. I work at the intersection of systems, storytelling, and user experience, helping teams figure out what they&apos;re actually building, why it matters, and how to get there without wasting effort.

I&apos;m a big believer in clarity. Whether I&apos;m mapping architecture, shaping a prototype, or running a workshop, my goal is always the same: make the complex feel simple, make decisions easier, and keep everyone aligned around a shared vision. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## What I Do

I help companies design and build digital products with confidence. That means diving into workflows, requirements, and data; sketching out how systems should behave; and then turning those insights into prototypes teams can test and iterate quickly.

Some days I&apos;m knee-deep in C4 diagrams or analytics. Other days I&apos;m running discovery sessions, simplifying dense interfaces, or aligning engineers, stakeholders, and end-users around a single direction. No matter the format, I focus on building products that make sense — for the people who use them and the teams that support them.

I bridge strategy and execution, design and engineering, concept and delivery. If something feels ambiguous, I&apos;m usually the one clarifying it. {{ className: 'lead' }}
