# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

The comments system now includes comprehensive security measures to protect against common attack vectors:

## Implemented Security Features

### 1. XSS Protection
- **DOMPurify Integration**: All user input is sanitized using isomorphic-dompurify
- **HTML Stripping**: Comments and author names are stripped of all HTML tags
- **Attribute Filtering**: Dangerous attributes like `onclick`, `onload`, `style` are forbidden

### 2. Input Validation
- **Length Limits**: 
  - Author names: 50 characters max
  - Comments: 2000 characters max
- **Required Fields**: Both author and content are required
- **Trimming**: Leading/trailing whitespace is automatically removed

### 3. Rate Limiting
- **Request Limits**: Maximum 10 comments per 5-minute window per client
- **Client Identification**: Uses IP + User-Agent for basic fingerprinting
- **Memory Storage**: In-memory rate limiting (use Redis in production)

### 4. Anti-Spam Measures
- **Memory Limits**: Maximum 1000 comments per item to prevent memory exhaustion
- **Comment Limits**: Rate limiting prevents comment flooding
- **URL Detection**: Comments containing URLs trigger captcha verification

### 5. Captcha Integration
- **Smart Triggers**: Captcha is triggered when:
  - User has submitted 2+ comments
  - Less than 30 seconds since last comment
  - Comment longer than 500 characters  
  - Comment contains URLs
- **Callback Interface**: Ready for integration with any captcha provider

## API Security Response Codes

- `400`: Validation errors (length limits, required fields, invalid mood)
- `429`: Rate limit exceeded
- `500`: Server errors

## Captcha Integration Example

To integrate a captcha modal, pass the `onCaptchaRequired` callback to ComponentDrawer:

\`\`\`tsx
const handleCaptchaRequired = async (): Promise<boolean> => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    // Show your captcha modal here
    // Return true if captcha passed, false if failed/cancelled
    
    // Example with a simple modal:
    const passed = window.confirm("Please verify you're human (demo captcha)")
    resolve(passed)
  })
}

<ComponentDrawer 
  // ... other props
  onCaptchaRequired={handleCaptchaRequired}
/>
\`\`\`

## Production Recommendations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Use Redis or database-backed rate limiting instead of in-memory storage
2. **Database**: Replace in-memory comment storage with proper database
3. **Authentication**: Add user authentication for better identity verification
4. **Logging**: Add security event logging for monitoring attacks
5. **CSP Headers**: Implement Content Security Policy headers
6. **CAPTCHA**: Integrate with reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, or similar service

## Attack Vectors Mitigated

✅ **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - DOMPurify sanitization  
✅ **Comment Spam** - Rate limiting and captcha triggers  
✅ **Memory Exhaustion** - Comment count limits  
✅ **Input Validation** - Length and content validation  
✅ **Identity Spoofing** - Basic client fingerprinting  
✅ **DoS Attacks** - Rate limiting per client  

## Testing the Security

Try these scenarios to test the security measures:

1. **XSS Test**: Try submitting `<script>alert('xss')</script>` - should be sanitized
2. **Rate Limit Test**: Submit multiple comments quickly - should trigger rate limiting
3. **Long Content Test**: Submit very long comment - should trigger captcha
4. **URL Test**: Include URLs in comment - should trigger captcha

The system is now hardened against common attack vectors while maintaining a good user experience.
