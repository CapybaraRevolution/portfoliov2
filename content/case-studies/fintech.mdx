<Section title="Project Overview">

**The Challenge**
Breeze Mortgage Hub needed to secure Series A funding but lacked a cohesive product vision. Investors couldn't understand the value proposition from scattered wireframes and documentation.

**The Solution**
I led a comprehensive UX audit and created interactive prototypes that clearly communicated the product strategy to stakeholders and investors.

<Section title="Process & Approach">

<Grid cols={2}>
  <div>
    **Discovery Phase**
    - Stakeholder interviews with 8 team members
    - Competitive analysis of 12 fintech apps
    - User journey mapping across 5 key flows
    - Technical constraint documentation
  </div>
  
  <div>
    **Design Phase**
    - Information architecture restructuring
    - High-fidelity prototype creation
    - Design system foundations
    - Investor presentation deck
  </div>
</Grid>

<Callout variant="info" title="AI-Accelerated Workflow">
Used Claude and GPT-4 to rapidly generate user personas, competitive analysis insights, and copy variations for testing. This accelerated the discovery phase by 40% while maintaining quality.

**Interactive Prototypes**
Created clickable prototypes that demonstrated the complete user journey from loan application to approval, helping investors understand the product's value proposition.

**Design System Foundation**
Established a scalable design system with consistent components, typography, and interaction patterns to support future development.

<Callout variant="success" title="Key Insight">
Investors need to see and feel the product experience, not just read about it. Interactive prototypes were 10x more effective than static presentations.
</Callout>

**What Worked:**
- AI-accelerated research and content generation
- Focusing on investor-specific user journeys
- Creating tangible, clickable experiences

**What I'd Do Differently:**
- Start with technical feasibility validation earlier
- Include more detailed implementation timelines
- Prepare for deeper technical due diligence questions
