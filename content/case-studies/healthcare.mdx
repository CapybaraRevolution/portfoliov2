<Section title="Project Overview">

**The Challenge**
Healthcare providers were spending 60% of their time on administrative tasks instead of patient care. The existing portal was fragmented, making it difficult to access critical patient information quickly.

**The Solution**
Redesigned the healthcare portal with a focus on care coordination, streamlined workflows, and intelligent data presentation that prioritized the most relevant information for each user role.

<Section title="Research & Discovery">

<Grid cols={2}>
  <div>
    **User Research**
    - 24 healthcare provider interviews
    - 3-day shadowing sessions in clinical settings
    - Workflow analysis across 4 departments
    - Patient journey mapping
  </div>
  
  <div>
    **Data Analysis**
    - Portal usage analytics review
    - Task completion time measurements
    - Error rate and support ticket analysis
    - Accessibility audit findings
  </div>
</Grid>

<Callout variant="info" title="AI-Enhanced Research">
Leveraged AI tools to analyze interview transcripts, identify patterns across user feedback, and generate initial persona drafts. This reduced analysis time from 2 weeks to 4 days while uncovering deeper insights.
