- Clear error messages for any issues
- Name is remembered in modal session

**For Bad Actors:**
- All inappropriate content blocked
- Captcha prevents automated spam
- Rate limiting stops flooding
- Server-side validation prevents bypass attempts

## üîß Production Notes

- Turnstile keys are properly configured
- All environment variables secured in .env.local
- Comments still stored in-memory (will clear on restart)
- Ready for database integration when needed

The system is fully operational and protecting against all identified attack vectors!
