# Case Study Tone Guide: The Art of Professional Cheekiness

This document catalogues the voice and tone conventions used across portfolio case studies. The goal: sound like a human who knows their craft and doesn't take themselves too seriously—while still being credible enough to hire.

## Core Principles

1. **Confidence without arrogance** — You know what you're doing. You don't need to prove it with jargon.
2. **Self-aware humor** — Poke fun at the industry, the process, and yourself. Never at the client or the user.
3. **Earned irreverence** — The cheeky moments land because the surrounding content is substantive.
4. **Distributed, not concentrated** — Spread personality throughout. Don't front-load all the jokes.

## Techniques & Examples

### 1. Parenthetical Asides

Short, punchy commentary inserted mid-sentence. Works best when it acknowledges an uncomfortable truth or adds a wink.

**Examples:**

From Cornell:
> "...when stakeholder opinions diverged (which they will, because they're stakeholders)."

> "What We Knew *(or at least what we could agree upon.)*"

From Breeze:
> "This wasn't a single handoff file. (Those usually collect dust anyway.)"

> "Less time arguing = more time refining the product. (Also, more time for them to find other things to argue about.)"

**When to use:** After stating something that could sound overly formal or process-heavy. The parenthetical humanizes it.

---

### 2. Cheeky Tooltips

Tooltips that start with a legitimate definition, then add personality. The structure is: *[Actual explanation] + [Self-aware commentary]*.

**Examples:**

From Cornell:
> **"data-driven"** — "Buzzword for 'I looked at some numbers before making this decision' (usually said while pointing at a chart)."

> **"10,000 ft"** — "Consultant terminology for looking at something from a high-level perspective (usually while standing very far away from the actual problem)."

> **"numbers can't explain"** — "Seriously, you just watch people click on the same things for hours. *It's a good thing you were thinking of paying me to do this for you.*"

From Breeze:
> **"information architecture"** — "The structural design of how content and features are organized, labeled, and connected—think of it as the blueprint for where things live and how users find them. (The invisible scaffolding users never notice unless you screw it up.)"

> **"dev-ready"** — "Specifications detailed enough that engineers can build from them without guesswork—including edge cases, states, and expected behaviors. Also known as 'answering the questions before the Slack thread spirals.'"

> **"discovery"** — "The research phase where you learn about users, business goals, and constraints before designing anything—interviews, audits, and lots of 'why?' questions. (The part where you ask 'why?' so many times people start avoiding your Slack messages.)"

> **"de-risked"** — "Reducing uncertainty by testing ideas before building—cheaper to fix a prototype than production code. (Consultant-speak for 'we found the problems before they became someone else's emergency.')"

> **"happy path theatre"** — "The demo version of reality where WiFi is always fast, users never misclick, and edge cases don't exist."

**When to use:** On industry jargon that deserves a gentle roast, or terms that might sound impressive but benefit from being demystified.

### 3. Playful Metaphors with Payoff

Extended metaphors that make a point while keeping things light. The key is to acknowledge you're doing it.

**Examples:**

From Cornell:
> "We used data the same way you'd use a map, not to admire it, but to plot your course. *If we wanted to find the buried treasure we'd first need to know what direction to go.*"

> "Ask any archeologist and they'll tell you that if you want to *actually* find the treasure, you eventually do have to drop the map, bust out your metal detector and start digging..."

> "Fun metaphors aside, the point of UX research isn't to drown in dashboards."

**When to use:** When explaining a process that could sound dry. Commit to the metaphor, then acknowledge it before moving on.

---

### 4. Confident First-Person Voice

Statements that show personality and ownership without hedging.

**Examples:**

From Cornell:
> "I thrive on chaos. Take a big mess and throw me into the deep-end... I'll come back with charts, graphs and relevant memes."

> "I was dead-set on creating wireframes and documentation that Cornell's internal team could own and evolve."

From Breeze:
> "If you've ever been the translator between 'founder brain' and 'what engineers actually need to build,' you know this is less about design and more about diplomacy."

**When to use:** In "My Role" or approach sections. Own your perspective.

---

### 5. Industry Snark (Affectionate)

Gentle jabs at common industry behaviors, frameworks, or tendencies.

**Examples:**

From Cornell:
> "The output wasn't a giant research deck or 12 step plan, but a practical map."

> "UX Research: Fun for Everyone" *(section title, tongue-in-cheek)*

> "...backed by evidence we could point to in a meeting without theatrics."

From Breeze:
> "...so the UI has 'design DNA,' not vibes"

> "so shipping doesn't become an interpretive sport"

> "(spoiler: mortgage software rarely handles it well)"

**When to use:** When describing what you *didn't* do, or when contrasting good practice with common dysfunction.

---

### 6. The Sausage Principle

Relatable, slightly absurd imagery that makes a point stick.

**Examples:**

From Breeze:
> "Users don't need to understand how the sausage is made. They just need to trust the sausage."

**When to use:** Sparingly. One memorable line per case study is enough.

## Distribution Guidelines

| Section | Cheekiness Level | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| Hero / Intro | Low | Let the work speak first |
| The Problem | Medium | Okay to acknowledge the mess |
| My Role | Medium-High | This is where voice comes through |
| Approach / Process | Medium | Tooltips and parentheticals work well here |
| AI / Technical | Low-Medium | Keep it grounded, one joke max |
| Outcomes | Low | Let the results be serious |
| Learnings | Medium | Good place for a punchline or two |
| Credits | Low | Respectful, not funny |

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't mock the client** — They trusted you with their problem.
- **Don't undermine your own work** — Self-deprecating is fine; self-sabotaging is not.
- **Don't force it** — If a section doesn't need personality, leave it alone.
- **Don't stack jokes** — One cheeky moment per paragraph, max.
- **Don't use emoji** — The tone is dry, not bubbly.

## Final Note

The goal isn't to be funny. The goal is to be *human*. The cheekiness signals: "I've done this enough times to have opinions, and I'm confident enough to share them without hiding behind corporate-speak."

When in doubt, ask: *Would I actually say this in a client meeting after we've built some rapport?* If yes, it probably works.
