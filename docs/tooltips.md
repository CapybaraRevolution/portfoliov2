# Tooltip Inventory

A quick record of tooltip terms and definitions currently used across the site. Terms are bolded inline in case studies and render via `Tooltip`.

- **Information architecture** — Blueprint for how content/features are organized and found.
- **Component behavior** — Reusable UI blocks behaving consistently everywhere.
- **Dev-ready** — Requirements detailed enough that engineers can build without guesswork.
- **Discovery** — Research phase to learn users, goals, constraints before designing.
- **Competitive scanning** — Reviewing competitor products to spot patterns/gaps.
- **De-risked** — Testing ideas early to reduce uncertainty before build.
- **Component patterns** — Standardized rules for how UI elements look/behave.
- **Progressive disclosure** — Revealing info gradually to avoid overwhelming users.
- **Clickable prototypes** — Interactive mockups stakeholders can click through.
- **Happy path theatre** — Demos that only show ideal scenarios, not real-world edge cases.
- **Design system** — Figma library of reusable components with tokens and interaction logic.
- **UX artifacts** — Deliverables (wireframes, personas, journeys) for shared context.
- **IA maps** — Blueprint of how pages/features connect and how users navigate.
- **Acceptance criteria** — Conditions that define "done" before code is written.

- **GA** — Google Analytics; traffic/event data at scale.
- **Personas** — Research-backed archetypes to anchor decisions.
- **Reusable page modules** — Prebuilt page blocks with shared inputs/variants/rules.
- **Navigation system** — Governed global/sectional/in-page patterns with naming rules.
- **Design debt** — Accumulated inconsistencies that slow future work.
- **Design system** — Figma library of reusable components with tokens and motion curves.
- **Spacing/token logic** — Standardized design tokens for spacing/color/type.
- **PRD-lite** — Lightweight requirements capturing intent, states, and edge cases.
