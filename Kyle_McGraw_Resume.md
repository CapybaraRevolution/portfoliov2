**Senior Product Designer — Design Systems**

---

## Summary

Design systems architect with 8+ years building scalable UI systems in fintech and other high-trust domains. Comfortable in code and in Figma: design tokens, component libraries, theming, motion patterns, and developer-facing documentation that teams ship from. Translates high-craft design into reusable systems — then writes the specs, usage rules, and governance that make adoption stick. Reduced UI development cycle time by 42% and design rework by 34% through structured documentation and systematic component architecture.

- Defined 40 exported TypeScript interface contracts with Tessitura field mapping; wrote API service stubs to unblock backend development and maintain design-engineering alignment.
- Established semantic component architecture (primitives, semantic, feature) with 1,100+ lines of developer documentation across 6 structured spec files with extensive inline comments.
- Created plug-and-play theming system enabling new tenant brand onboarding without redesigning components — Houston Ballet as proof case with system ready for scale.
- Championed accessibility standards and scalable UX patterns across React-based internal tools and client-facing applications.

- Designed AI-powered document classification that replaced manual labeling — demonstrating how systems thinking extends beyond components to feature patterns.
- Delivered investor-ready prototypes that helped secure $2.3M in Series A funding, compressing months-long alignment to approximately one week.
- Ran guerrilla usability research to validate design system patterns in real user contexts: screened participants, A/B tested flows, iterated on findings.

### Briteweb — Senior UX Designer / Strategist (Contract) | Aug 2023 – Dec 2024

UX strategy and modular design systems for enterprise clients in education, nonprofit, and social finance.

- Reduced UI ticket cycle time by 42% and design rework by 34% through structured documentation, state-change matrices, and implementation review processes.
- Improved onboarding completion rate approximately 25% through data-driven funnel analysis (DeltaDNA) and iterative design.
- Evangelized design system adoption across 3 independent studios through prototypes, shared specs, and a common design language — driving consistency on a licensed IP with high visual standards.
